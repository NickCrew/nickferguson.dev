Part 2 of the _[Bits of My Life](/series/bio)_ series

## Remember Biege Computers? 

I was enamored with the computer from a very young age and was lucky that my mom bought us a computer back in the mid 90s. 
Unfortunately, the rural location in which we lived meant that I was not able 
to get truly serious about things like Linux, until I was about 13. The age at which, you may recall from Part 1, I first got access to high-speed cable internet the second release of Ubuntu.  

You might wonder why, then, having discovered computers well before college age, I only waited until I was 27 before attempting to realize a career out of that interest.  

Well, my other great love growing up was horses and, unlike my experience with computers, I knew a lot of other people with horses in my community. So by the the time I was in high-school it was quite natural to find myself training performance quarter horses full-time. I was also doing an increasing amount of equine therapy as word started getting around about my horse Twilight and I amongst the parents and families of autistic kids in our area. 


## Detour Into The Rural Ohio Public School System

I hated school as a kid. I always did well academically, which is probably the only thing that saved me, but I also pushed the envelope when it came to being absent.  

I was one of the first students in my rural school to be allowed to try the new "virtual academy". The school saw this as a solution to the problem of students like me who tended to miss being "counted" each year and so deprive the school of one less student's worth of funding from the state. 

This seemed like a a glorious idea in theory but my home life was virtually without structure by this point and the results were as you might expect. I spent most of my time learning.... what _I_ wanted to learn about (mostly Linux and desktop hardware at the time). We began moving enough that the regular changing of school districts provided me some cover. Sometime in my senior year they seemed to lose interest in having me there, I suppose in anticipation of me turning 18 in April. I just sort of stopped going and nobody really said much about it 

There were a few teachers that had an enourmously positive impact on me, mainly a history teacher and an English teacher, and that if they were representative of the school system things may have played out differently for me.  

## Maximum Humidity  

I was still in the horse business many years later, althought no longer in Ohio, when it was necesssary that I move to Florida to take care of my mom. In 2014 I arrived in Tampa Bay, Florida and started over from scratch. 

Once things stablized a bit, it did not take me long to come to the conclusion that while computers and 
Linux had always been a significant part of my life now was the time to get paid for it as it was really the 
only skill I could see a path towards putting it to use in this state.

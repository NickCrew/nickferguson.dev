There are new variations every day of people asking the same question: "Do I need a (CS) degree to have a career as a software developer?"  

They are always answered the same way: "No, but it helps, mostly if you want to go into management or work for a company that requires a bachelors one day."  

### (Skip) MIT License 

I agree with that statement but I don't think it's the whole truth. I don't think it's the whole truth because of what, in my opinion, all of these questions are really asking:

"Is there an easy way?"    

And the answer is "Yes, going to college is the easy way". 

### 1 Year of Experience

When you go to a university for a bachelors degree in computer science, there is a path that, if you follow it, you will most likely find yourself doing professional software engineering about 5 years later.  

We first need to establish something important though:  

Nobody gets a job in software engineering with 0 years of experience.  

"But what about new grads?"  

No. 

If you go to a 4-year school, and do 1 3-month internship each summer, by the time you graduate you have 12 months of experience and a bachelors degree. This tells employers a lot about you:

- You can commit to something that takes 4 years and not quit
- You have worked somewhere for money before and presumably not gotten fired
- You (probably) contributed, if only a small way, to a real production code base and witnessed the software development life cycle up close. 


It is pretty common that someone is able to complete their fancy computer science degree, but they did no internships, have a crap GPA, and are on reddit moaning about sending off 1000 applications.   

It is also pretty common that one of those four internships offers you your first job once you graduate because youre basically guaranteed not to be a crazy person, an asshole, or totally incompetent.  

That is the pipeline and washes out into the promised land.

### Professional Summary

I am a professional software engineer specializing in platforms and infrastructure. 

I compiled my first Linux kernel when I was 13 to take advantage of Hyper Threading on my new Pentium 4.  

In the past I have worked as a full-time portrait photographer, trained performance quarter horses and managed guest services at a destination hotel.

I still do photography on the side, along with inkjet printmaking and custom finishing.

I'm Nick Ferguson, a senior engineer at [Vispero](https://vispero.com), where I've been working on the modernization of the the software development platform.  

Most of my interests relate to platform engineering, site reliability, and web development.  

Linux and free software has been a big part of my life since I was a kid and so when I started to get serious about
programming I naturally fell into developing platform and infrastructure projects.  

Before I did software engineering professionally, I was into a pretty wide variety of work ranging from photography to training performance horses.

You have to _really_ believe this deeply.  

I believe any problem can be solved. The only question is how much time and money do you have? 

When I first started doing software professionally I quicky realized that I needed to literally remove _can't_ from my vocabulary. 

I may not be able to do it _faster_ than everyone else, but I do believe that with enough time there is no problem I can't solve. 

You have to latch onto problems like a  bull dog and not go until someone says _"STOP!"_. 

I have worked on problems for months without a break, but __you have to be methodical__. Even if you are only able to do trial and error, do not just start pounding your head against the wall. __Change *one* parameter at a time and systematically troubleshoot until you find a solution.__

This is how you solve hard problems that other people cannot.

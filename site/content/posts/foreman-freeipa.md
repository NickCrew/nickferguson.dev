### Synopsis

FreeIPA (Red Hat Identity Management) provides DNS, DHCP, directory services, authentication via kerberos, single sign-on, automating of shared file systems including home directories, automatic DNS record creation.  

The Foreman (Red Hat Satellite) and Katello allow full life cycle management of physical and virtual resources along with configuration management via Puppet or Ansible.  

It is possible to connect the FreeIPA realm to Foreman so that when a new host is created in Foreman, it will have a DNS record created automatically, SSH keys, user home and other network shares mounted. It will immediately be accessible with a single sign-on account after boot up.  
This configuration should enable you to integrate FreeIPA and Foreman + Katello in such a way that

### FreeIPA Host

We need to create an IPA user for foreman. I used *"foreman-user"* but you can choose something different if you'd like. This article will assume *"foreman-user"*. Avoid foreman-proxy or other usernames that occur as users on the Foreman host. Assign this user the __role__ of *Smart Proxy Host Manager*.

Before beginning, your Foreman host needs to be registered as an IPA host. 

````bash
$ ipa-client-install
````

We need to create a __service__ for the Foreman proxy.  

If you're using the FreeIPA webui:  

> *Identity* => *Services* => *"add +"*

#### Example

> foremanproxy/foreman.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM

---

### Foreman Host

You need to install the `ipa-admintools` package:  
````bash
$ yum install ipa-admintools
$ foreman-prepare-realm admin foreman-user
````
  

Now we need to edit some config files.

##### */etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/freeipa_realm.yml*

````bash
# /etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/freeipa_realm.yml

# Authentication for Kerberos-based Realms
:keytab_path: /etc/foreman-proxy/freeipa.keytab
:principal: foreman-user@EXAMPLE.COM

:ipa_config: /etc/ipa/default.conf
# Remove from DNS when deleting the FreeIPA entry
:remove_dns: true
````


##### */etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/realm.yml*

````bash
# /etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/realm.yml

# Can be true, false, or http/https to enable just one of the protocols
:enabled: true

# Available providers:
#   realm_ad
#   realm_freeipa
:use_provider: realm_freeipa
````

---

### FreeIPA Host
Copy the keytab from the IPA server, where *freeipa* is the hostname of your IPA server and *foremanproxy* is the name of the service:

````bash
$ ipa-getkeytab -s freeipa.example.com -p foremanproxy/freeipa.example.com -k /etc/krb5.keytab *
````

Copy the keytab to the appropriate location.

````bash
$ cp freeipa.keytab /etc/foreman-proxy/freeipa.keyab
````


Make the foreman-proxy user owner and set correct permissions.

````bash
$ chown foreman-proxy /etc/foreman-proxy/freeipa.leytab
$ chmod 600 /etc/foreman-proxy/freeipa.keytab
$ cp /etc/ipa/ca.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ipa.crt
$ update-ca-trust enable && update-ca-trust
$ systemctl restart foreman-proxy
````

Test the keytab is present.

````bash
$ sudo -u foreman-user kinit -k -t /etc/foreman-proxy/freeipa.keytab foreman-user
````

You should now be able to select your realm in the Foreman webui  

> *Infrastructure* => *Realms*

Ensure your provisioning template calls the `freeipa_register` snippet. Read over the snippet to see optional host parameters you may set.  


*If you are using FreeIPA as your DNS server and you would like the records automatically updated, set the following host parameter:*

> `Name: `freeipa_opts Value: ÃŽ-enable-dns-updates`


*If you are using the automount feature of FreeIPA:*

> `Name: freeipa_automount Value: true`

Now when you create a host, as long as you have your realm selected, it should automatically join the realm and register with the server.

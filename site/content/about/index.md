I'm Nick Ferguson and I currently work at [Vispero](https://vispero.com), where I lead the design and development of the software build and release platform.

I'm originally from Ohio, where I worked as a horse trainer in an attempt to make a career of the only thing I like more than computers. These days I live in Tampa Bay, Florida, which has grown on me since acclimating and becoming one of those people wearing hoodies when its 70 degrees.  

I have had a love and curiosity for Linux since I was a kid that has always remained interesting to follow. As a
software engineer now, that background has led me to be primarily interested in virtual infrastructure, distributed systems, hosting platforms and site reliability, build and release processes and development tools.

## Hey is that a soapbox?...

It has been my experience that relationships, communication, and trust are critical to good software development, but many times it's only the absence that's noticed.

I think that is doubly true if you are working in build and release, site reliability or platform development because you will often have an outsized impact on the experience many engineers through
your design of development tools, processes, standards, and conventions. After those things are implemented you also have to protect them. That means you will inevitably have to say "no" to someome or stand up for a position.  

One part of trust is that software engineers should be empowered and then trusted with that power to pick the right tools and design good solutions.   

Teaching, mentoring, and technical writing skills are also required in any software team. Unfortunately, their quality varies wildly. I have benefitted from good mentorship and while it may not be absolutely required, it undoubtedly makes the early professional experience less daunting and more well-rounded. Most of what I learned from my first mentor that I really value were not so much technical but were about the realities of professional software engineering, beaurocracy and politics, and our role in an organization in relation to the bottom line.  

I'm not sure what it would look like, but it would be nice to see some focus on these "soft skills" as part of an engineering education. I think we probably expect that most of these things are by-products of institutionalized education but if that is true it is likely too lacking in context.  

One thing is for sure: You are responsible for your own education and you will need to ensure it does not stagnate if you want to make a living out of software engineering. Curiosity is the most important attribute to a good programmer, in my opinion, and I think if you can maintain that curiosity and find places that provide motivation and excitement, you will always have plenty of work creating software.

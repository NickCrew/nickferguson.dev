Part 1 of my _[Bits of My Life](/series/bio)_ series.

## Fade in from Black ... *Modem Screeches Wistfully*

The year was 2005 and I had moved literally to the wrong side of the tracks, but I had cable internet for the first time ever after a decade spent on 56k. The internet didn't suck yet and loading a JPEG was not a suspense-filled event. The first time I encountered Linux was a couple years prior when the old stoner that ran the dial-up ISP for our town had given me a Fedora Core CD. I was immediately drawn in by the smooth, alien icons of the GNOME desktop. Firefox was still part of The Mozilla Suite.

But it was not yet meant to be. Partially due to my 56k situation and partially due to my weak, unformed mind. Windows
XP felt hostile now though. I had peered through the looking glass and I _wanted_ it. I didn't have any motivation or
reason other than an instinctual drive telling me _that_ was what I needed.  

## Reunited
Once I got cable internet, and in this place where truly nothing good could come of me going outside, I was finally able
to let the riptide that was the Internet in 2005 pull me out to sea. I was downloading things in hours that used to take
me _weeks_! I was playing games other than Runescape! And I was seeing Linux mentioned on the forums (remember phpBB? how I long..).  

  

Ubuntu had burst onto the scene in 2004 with the Warty Warthog in what I believe will be the only thing close to a true
Year of the Linux desktop because no matter how you feel about Ubuntu today, it revolutionized desktop Linux. I have
always felt a kinship with the noble badger and so it is fitting that for me, Ubuntu 5.10 Breezy Badger would be my
first introduction to Linux. I immediately resolved that I would not be doing this dual-booting thing. I was not
concerned about playing my games because I only wanted to do one thing now: use Linux. I wiped my drive and installed
the badger.

And everything was broken. My display resolution was stuck at 800x600, I had no audio, all the usual suspects. In fact
what made Ubuntu revolutionary on the desktop was not that it worked so much better in the beginning, but the Ubuntu
Forums. The Ubuntu community was so on-board this Linux for Human Beings train that the official forums exploded with
stupid questions and people patiently answering them and helping noobs learn how to ask questions on a Forum in the
first place. You knew that first and foremost, someone probably already asked about your problem and solved it, or
someone wrote a guide about it, but that even if you had to be brave and post your question you knew you were not going
to be torn down to your essence of shame and regret.  

## Year of the Linux Desktop

Ubuntu no-doubt focused hard on usability and things like audio and media codecs, Xorg, Wi-Fi quickly became
out-of-the-box functionality. And people loved it. You still had to earn it though. It was a battle to accomplish many
things that were not a problem on Windows due its first-class vendor support and licensing...stuff. The Ubuntu community
was providing a framework and encouragement that gave a dumb kid like me just enough support to stick with it and keep
figuring stuff out. Once I figured out what the Linux kernel was, and that I needed to compile a custom version to get
the hyper-threading working on my Pentium 4, it was on.  

Getting a Linux desktop that worked was the best way for a kid to learn Linux at the time. It's not like I had a job
down at the datacenter on the corner. And if Linux had "just worked" (like it pretty much does now, lets be real), I
would not have faced the challenges that drove me deeper into the system.  

I spent the next few years obsessed with learning Linux for the sake of learning Linux. Times were getting exciting too.
We were entering the Compiz Age - a period of breathtaking true transparency, rotating desktop cubes and wobbly windows. I started looking for
"harder" distributions to use like Gentoo and Arch (my favorite desktop Linux to this day).

## But Can My Grandma Use it?

My parent have been Linux users for going on 20 years and I'm not sure they even know it. It did not take long before
our house became 100% free and open-source. Even in those days, if you only used your computer to get online and
organize your pictures, Linux had your back. It was only when you tried bringing that proprietary crap you got on CDs
with electronics from Best Buy that you had problems. Linux has had great hardware support for many a'year. Thats why
Windows needs those dumb CDs.  

And there was nothing I hated more than fixing Windows machines. Once I put my parents on Linux it was set-and-forget
and has been ever since. I knew they couldn't break it if they tried. I recently mailed my dad a laptop with Ubuntu pre-installed. He has no idea what Ubuntu is but he does know what Firefox is now and that's all that matters to him. 

Occasionally I would get suckered into helping a neighbor or family member with their crappy Windows machine. But I only
offered one service: Installing Ubuntu. And I never had an unhappy customer. There is probably a Compaq desktop out
there still running one of my Ubuntu installs being used by a 90 year old man that has memorized the steps to turn on
his PC and get to the Firefox. Once System76 started shipping laptops with Ubuntu as a first-class citizen, I, a kid
with far too long that couldn't even drive yet, was helping some of my 'clients' purchase $1000+ laptops by a
manufacturer they've never heard of with an operating they've never heard of (what's an operating system?). I never said
anything about Linux to these people though. I asked what they did on their computer (i.e. 20 different
misunderstandings of what the internet is) and told them I could make it so they could do their stuff on a computer that
will never get viruses, slow down or crash. I probably could've been charging if not for the fact that most of the
people I helped were out of obligation because my dad probably owed them rent or something and my mom asked me to help
them. Desktop computers have sort of gone the way of the do-do lately but I still massacre a Windows install
occasionally.  

## Flashback

Free software and Linux has been one of the more consistent threads woven throughout my life. When I was 17 I fell into photography for a few years and built my entire post-processing workflow on free software. Since it would be several years after leaving high school before I started taking college classes and doing software development professionally, I went 15 years without ever using, seeing or caring about proprietary software or Windows operating systems.  {{< resize-image src="twilight-1.jpg" alt="My Horse, Twilight" caption="Twilight - My favorite horse" >}} The Internet was not, however, my first obession. Horses have been the other constant and for many years I viewed the computers as the hobby and the horses as a livelihood, perhaps because that was something that took shape so naturally.

## The Fall

My computer and Linux had been a fortress into which I had retreated when life around me was in chaos. My living
situation had changed dramatically and structures I once thought immovable and impervious were crashing down around me.
But I had that cable internet. Nobody ever told me to get off my computer and if I was not
nerding on Linux I was talking to friends online. Believe it or not there was a time when you had real friends online
from all over the world that were very similar to you. I feel like my years on the internet gave me a better a liberal
arts education than I ever could've gotten from a University.  

Then I made a grave mistake. I went outside. Before this I'm not sure if the other kids in this burg even knew a kid
lived in that house. I had moved from a place with no neighbors on three sides of me for miles and a private creek
behind my house to a slum next to train tracks. I was angsty and resentful as you might expect, but, again, I had that
cable internet. Up to this point I had only my best friend Jake who I'd since first grade. He had just gotten his
license and a girlfriend so I would occasionally find myself bored at the times I had gotten used to him being around.  

## Trials and Tribulations

I have had an interesting life since then and Linux has accompanied through it all in one way or another. When I was 18
and 19 I became obsessed with photography for a while and even though Adobe apps were not difficult to obtain, I chose
to build my photo workflow around free software like GIMP, Digikam, UFRaw and others and I am glad I did.  

My first great love, even before Linux, has been horses and I spent several years training horses and running a public riding stable.  

I had plucked at a guitar since I was a guitar since I was young as well and I later discovered the importance of music. I went to music festivals for a while, taking photos, and discovered the Grateful Dead, which quickly became another one of my obsessions and now is something I can't imagine living life without.  

## Training Montage

I was practically teleported to Florida 7 years ago (along with my cat Zippy) out of necessity. I fell into hospitality
work for a while, doing hotel guest services and revenue management.  

After stabilizing for a period of time I knew that it was time to do what everyone who knew me as a kid probably
expected me to do 10 years ago: make a career out of the computers  

All those years with Linux helped me jump in the deep end quickly (I'm more of a 'survival' swimmer than a leisure
swimmer) except this time I was discovering programming. If I thought I loved bashing my head against the rock that was
Linux boy was I in for a treat!

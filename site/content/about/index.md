__Hi, I'm Nick Ferguson.__  

I'm a professional software engineer specializing in Linux infrastructure, distributed systems and platform development.  

I also do photography on a semi-professional basis, primarily fine art, portraiture and fasion. Lately I've taken up inkjet printing and custom framing. [View my online portfolio](https://ferguson.photos).    

I have been working at [ThreatX](https://threatx.com), an API security startup, since the start of this year, on their _Performance and Reliability Team_.  

Before that, I was with [Vispero](https://vispero.com), a leader in blind and low-vision accessilibility technology, since 2018.  

I specialize in platform development, full-stack web development, and building distributed Linux-based systems and networks.

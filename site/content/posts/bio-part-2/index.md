Part 2 of the _[Bits of My Life](/series/bio)_ series

## Remember Biege Computers? 

I was enamored with the computer from a very young age and was lucky that my mom bought us a computer back in the mid 90s. 
Unfortunately, our the rural location in which we lived meant that I was not able 
to get truly serious about the things I am passionate about now, like Linux, until I was about 13, which you may recall
from part 1 of the series was when I first got access to the high-speed cable internet that allowed me to download 
the second release of Ubuntu.  

You might wonder why, then, having discovered computers well before college age, I only started applying that aptitude
professionally on the back 9 of my twenties...  

Well, my other great love growing up was horses and, unlike my experience with computers, I knew a lot of
other people with horses and in the business in my community so by the the time I was in high-school, 
I was training performance quarter horses in barrel racing as well as operating a small program on the side 
to provide disabled kids with equine therapy. You also travel a lot in the horse business and my other 
interests fit well into that lifestyle.  

So much had changed within my family and subsequently my self that what I expected from life as an 11 or 12 year old was profoundly
altered by the time I was a (legal) adult. And while the horse business doesn't often pay great unless you started
with money or you have put in the time that your name carries some weight, I did truly love my work and 
after all the chaos growing up after turning 12 or so I was quite satisified
that I was getting by without constantly struggle and that I was able to take care of my mom, as well. 

## Detour Into The Rural Ohio Public School System

I hated school as a kid. For the later grades I can articulate many reasons that my loathing of school was valid, or at
the very least explain it, but in the early years when that feeling was cemented so strongly, I can't really say why I
hated it so much, only that I did. Neverthess I always did excellent in school, with a near-perfect report all the way
until middle school. My family life had remained relatively stable thanks to my mom until that point but the year I
started middle school also marked the year that my family would become more chaotic each year. 

I was one of the first (of maybe a half dozen?) students in my rural school to be allowed to try the new virtual
classroom programs, which they tellingly remarked would mean that I would technically now have perfect attentendance 
(because I was a detriment to their funding). This seemed like a a glorious idea in theory but my home life was
virtually without structure by this point and the results were as you might expect. I spent most of my time learning 
what _I_ wanted to learn about, and that was mostly Linux. I would change school districts once and attend just enough
days to to avoid truancy, the _effective_ threshold for which, I expect, would have been much lower had I not 
maintained some of the best grades in the school all those years). Though finally in my senior year I just 
stopped going at all and nobody ever said a word about it.  

I would point out that there were a few teachers that had an enourmously positive impact on me, mainly a history teacher and an
English teacher, and that if they were representative of the school system things may have played out differently for
me. 

## Maximum Humidity  

Eventually, family circumstances would necessitate that I move to Florida in order to take care of my mom. I exited
any other business I was relying on at the time and essentially began from scratch after arriving in Tampa Bay,
Florida. Once things stablized a bit, it did not take me long to come to the conclusion that while computers and 
Linux had always been a significant part of my life now was the time to get paid for it as it was really the 
only skill I could see a path towards putting it to use in this state.  

I had always stayed pretty current with the happenings in the free sofqtware and Linux world. I had built my photography
workflow around 100% free software and even my parents were Linux usersqs (whether they knew it or not). However, once I 
decided I wanted to be a professional, I began wading into as much information I could find to learn exactly what people 
like me were doing at their job and how I could leverage my fundamental knowledge of Linux and networking into a job. It
didn't take long before I came upon all the books and information about things like site reliability engineer, agile
development, 'DevOps', and continuous delivery. By the time I convinced them tiqqqo give me a shot at Vispero, I knew more
than the average bear about those topics and that helped my career begin in the unusual place it did.  

Writing automation and tools at Vispero is how I discovered _real programming and I was immediately hooked so that was when I knew I wanted to
keep programming, (and for as much time as I could) but in a way that my lifetime's worth of knowledge abqout systems and
networks, especially Linux, would be most valuable. And that is how my main interests came to be things like 
platform development, site reliability, infrastructure design and full-stack web development.

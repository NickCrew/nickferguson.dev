#### Software should solve problems for people

Whether I'm trying to build consensus or just determine my own priorities, I always ask myself _"What problems is this solving and for whom?"_ There is no end to the things we could potentially improve, enhance or otherwise 'do right' whtin any given company. This is how I know what architecture iniatives are worth the cost.

#### Prioritize customer success above all else, including your own

This applies equally to internal stakeholders and external customers. 
__Relentlessly advocating for your customer is something I have never regretted doing.__ 
Additionally, realizing that your customer is not some other business but real people with real problems.
